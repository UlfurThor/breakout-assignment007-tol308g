# breakout_assignment007


Here are the slides, which give the background for this assignment, and some marking guidance:

Your version of Breakout should be submitted via a link to your personal webspace on https://notendur.hi.is/, which you can edit via ugla...

Your implementation needs to support 'P' for pause, 'O' for single-step, 'C' for clear-toggle and *all the other stuff* from our version of "PONG!". It must also use the "requestAnimationFrame" mechanism to correctly support variable delta-times and arbitrary refresh rates...

So, basically, you should just build it on top of the framework that I created for PONG. A significant number of marks will be deducted if you don't provide these "framework facilities" --- they are very useful during development, and are also hugely helpful when it comes to marking.

My version of that framework (finally split into multiple files), which you should copy as a starting-point, can be found here:

(via "view source" in your browser)

Your submission should include a brief list of all the "cool" things which you added beyond the minimum. Each cool thing will potentially earn an additional 10% (on top of the 50% baseline for "minimal breakout"), if it's good enough.

Also, because this exercise is a bit harder, and perhaps a bit more time-consuming, I'm going to give it a higher weighting than a typical homework -- i.e. 8 percent of the total grade, as opposed to the usual 4 percent.

Good Luck.
